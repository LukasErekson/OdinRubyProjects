 # Connect Four

This is a console version of the game [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) implemented in Ruby. This project was made as a part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/). The primary purpose of this particular project was to try out a strict version of Test-Driven Development. This means that all the tests written using RSpec were written *before* the functionality was implemented.

Once the project is completed, a fully-playable version will be available to play online as a [replit repository](https://replit.com/@LukasErekson/Connect-Four#main.rb).
