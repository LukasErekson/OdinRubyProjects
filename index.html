              This is a compilation of all the exercises and projects I've done as part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming" target="_blank">The Odin Project's Ruby Programming course</a>. The repository contains all my solutions to the regular ruby exercises, but I'm particularly proud of my work on the projects.

              This page is a reflection on the important concepts I learned during the projects rather than the details of the projects themselves. The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/lukaserekson/OdinRubyProjects">on my GitHub.</a>
            </p>

            <p>
              I tried to go above and beyond for each of the projects, so I hope you can take the time to see them in action. I tried to learn and implement a new best-practice in each of my successive projects. For instance, several projects come with their own unit tests using RSpec while others also have their own RDoc documentation.

          <h5>Creating games to play in the terminal</h5>
        </header>
        
        <p>
          Several of the early projects in The Odin Project are simple games meant to be played in the terminal. This lent itself well to learning and applying the syntax for parsing user input and saving files. Two games that I feel I implemented really well are <a href="https://replit.com/@LukasErekson/TOP-Tic-Tac-Toe#main.rb" target="_blank">Tic-Tac-Toe</a> and <a href="https://replit.com/@LukasErekson/TOP-Mastermind#main.rb" target="_blank">Mastermind</a>. The source code for each of these games as well as a playable version online are available as replit.io repositories.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Of the two, Mastermind is my favorite. I was able to use a gem that allowed for colored output, and I feel like I handled errors and exceptions well. I also implemented a basic algorithm that allows the player to input a code and the computer to "guess" their code. Feel free to play a couple of rounds of the game by <a href="https://replit.com/@LukasErekson/TOP-Mastermind#main.rb" target="_blank">clicking here</a>. <a href="https://replit.com/@LukasErekson/TOP-Tic-Tac-Toe#main.rb" target="_blank">Tic-Tac-Toe</a>, however, is a cleaner, more standard project as I went back and refactored the code when I was learning more about automated testing.

          <h1>Testing, Testing, 1 2 3...</h1>
          <h5>Learning RSpec to verify solutions and drive development</h5>
        </header>
        
        <p>
          Using the spec files provided for the exercises and looking up the documentation, I started to create RSpec test files for most of the projects. I wanted to practice writing unit tests and try RSpec's "behavior driven development" methodology. My previous experience with Python during my undergraduate research (see <a href="">my Rootfinding fork</a>) instilled in me the importance of creating and using unit tests. I created my own unit tests for nearly all of the projects before the course formally covered testing.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Out of them all, I'm most proud of the work I did with <a href="https://github.com/LukasErekson/OdinRubyProjects/tree/main/linked_list" target="_blank">Linked List</a>. It was the first project that I really tried to do Test-Driven Development. I wrote out the spec file that tested for the specific behaviors and outputs for my <tt>LinkedList</tt> class before implementing any of the methods. Doing so gave me not only a clear end-goal, but it also helped me identify errors when handling the edge cases that I may not have caught otherwise. I had a similar experience when implementing the Binary Search Tree project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I started to learn a little bit about generating documentation using RDoc. You can find the source code for the classes and the spec files <a href="https://github.com/LukasErekson/OdinRubyProjects/tree/main/linked_list">by clicking here</a>. If you're interested in browsing the generated documentation, that can be found <a href="./linked_list/doc/index.html">here</a>.

        <header>
          <h1>Data Structures & Algorithms</h1>
          <h5>Implementing algorithms - from pseudocode to Ruby</h5>
        </header>

        <p>
          The Odin Project provided me with several opportunities to implement algorithms from pseudocode. For instance, my <tt>Mastermind</tt> implementation includes an algorithm that allows the program to systematically determine the user's secret code. The sections on recursion, including the Binary Search Tree, also gave me a lot of opportunity to consider carefully how to translate an abstract structure and algorithm into clean, usable code.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I have a lot of experience implementing data structures and alogrithms from my undergraduate coursework in Python and C++, I felt very capable of breaking-down, implementing, and analyzing algorithms in Ruby.
