# The Odin Project Ruby Exercises & Projects

## About this repository

This repository is a complement to the Ruby course for The Odin Project. It contains my solutions to a series of Ruby exercises alongside pre-written tests that provided a Test Driven Development experience. The exercises contain my own solutions, and I have made sure they pass each test.

Consider visiting the [GitHub Pages Landing Page](https://lukaserekson.github.io/OdinRubyProjects/) for my reflection on what I have learned and done with the content of this repository.

This repository also contains some of the basic projects assigned in The Odin Project. Some, including the "Substrings" project, include tests that I have personally written before developing the solution to practice test driven development on my own. These projects represent my first foray into Ruby, and I'm proud to show my growth and abilities here.
